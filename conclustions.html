<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<br/>
<p>In recent years, the used car market has experienced price increases and information asymmetries due to various external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical issues, and supply chain disruptions, making buying a used car challenging for consumers. In response to these challenges, this project aims to provide consumers with valuable insights into the used car market by collecting and analyzing comprehensive vehicle data. Various machine learning techniques were utilized, such as clustering and association rule mining. Vehicle characteristics and their impact on price were identified and analyzed. The conclusions from using each machine learning technique are as follows.</p>
<br/>
<B>Clustering</B>
<p>By clustering the data based on the characteristics of used vehicles, the following insights were derived. K-means and hierarchical clustering, one of the partitioned clustering techniques, yielded similar results based on the data of each characteristic of a car. The three clusters clustered by K-means focused on price and were analyzed as representing affordable used cars, limited-budget used cars, and high-performance used cars. Hierarchical clustering similarly provided insights into each cluster, with clusters 1, 2, and 3 representing high-priced, economy, and low-priced used cars, respectively. Both clustering methods offer essential insights into vehicle characteristics, and you should consider which clustering technique to choose by first understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the nature and purpose of your data. Hierarchical clustering helps you better understand the structure of your data, while K-means provides faster clustering results. The result of each clustering is a total of three segments. The purpose of this project is to more rationally analyze vehicle characteristics that affect vehicle price. Focusing on vehicle price, the results can be analyzed as follows. First, the higher-priced clusters generally had higher values for horsepower and engine cylinders. However, their mileage and vehicle age were relatively average. On the other hand, the lower-priced clusters generally had lower values for horsepower and engine cylinders and very high mileage. In other words, the higher the horsepower and the number of cylinders, which represent the performance of the vehicle, the higher the price of the vehicle. Also, a negative correlation between mileage and vehicle price is observed. In the cluster with the average vehicle price, the values of horsepower and cylinder were low, but considering that the vehicles were relatively new, it can be observed that the newer the vehicle, the higher the vehicle price. This clustering analysis can provide insights into how different vehicle characteristics affect vehicle prices.</p>

<B>Association Rule Mining</B>
<p>Next, an analysis was conducted to identify highly correlated vehicle characteristics in different price ranges using association rule analysis. First, the following features were positively associated with low-priced vehicles: High mileage, FWD, Low Engine Displacement, Low Horsepower, Medium Cylinder, and Short Wheelbase. In other words, cars with high mileage have a relatively low price range, and FWD has a lower price compared to AWD. In addition, Short Wheelbase is a characteristic that represents the size of the vehicle, and smaller vehicles are more likely to be associated with lower prices. It can also be seen that the cylinder attribute of Medium Cylinder is associated with lower prices. In our dataset, a low-cylinder feature is a vehicle with three or fewer cylinders. However, the number is relatively small, so the Medium Cylinder attribute is more prominent in low-priced cars. In other words, the high prevalence of medium cylinders in low-priced vehicles can be interpreted as a result of the small number of low-cylinder vehicles. Next, medium-priced vehicles have characteristics between low-priced and high-priced cars, such as AWD and Medium Cylinder, 2015-2017, Medium Horsepower. It shows that these vehicle characteristics significantly impact the price of the vehicle. Finally, the features opposite to those of lower-priced vehicles are highly correlated for higher-priced cars. The High Cylinder attribute is associated with cars with six or more cylinders, which are relatively high-performance vehicles. In addition, High Torque and Very High Horsepower are also vehicle characteristics that represent high-performance vehicles. As a result of the association rule analysis, the association rules related to these high-performance vehicle characteristics were found in high-priced cars, and it can be interpreted that more of these vehicle characteristics form a high-priced vehicle price. In other words, these association rules can be used to identify factors that affect car prices and help buyers understand which cars with which conditions are likely to have high prices.</p>
