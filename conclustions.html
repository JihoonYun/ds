<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<br/>
<p>In recent years, the used car market has experienced price increases and information asymmetries due to various external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical issues, and supply chain disruptions, making buying a used car challenging for consumers. In response to these challenges, this project aims to provide consumers with valuable insights into the used car market by collecting and analyzing comprehensive vehicle data. Various machine learning techniques were utilized, such as clustering and association rule mining. Vehicle characteristics and their impact on price were identified and analyzed. The conclusions from using each machine learning technique are as follows.</p>
<br/>
<B>Clustering</B>
<p>By clustering the data based on the characteristics of used vehicles, the following insights were derived. K-means and hierarchical clustering, one of the partitioned clustering techniques, yielded similar results based on the data of each characteristic of a car. The three clusters clustered by K-means focused on price and were analyzed as representing affordable used cars, limited-budget used cars, and high-performance used cars. Hierarchical clustering similarly provided insights into each cluster, with clusters 1, 2, and 3 representing high-priced, economy, and low-priced used cars, respectively. Both clustering methods offer essential insights into vehicle characteristics, and you should consider which clustering technique to choose by first understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the nature and purpose of your data. Hierarchical clustering helps you better understand the structure of your data, while K-means provides faster clustering results. The result of each clustering is a total of three segments. The purpose of this project is to more rationally analyze vehicle characteristics that affect vehicle price. Focusing on vehicle price, the results can be analyzed as follows. First, the higher-priced clusters generally had higher values for horsepower and engine cylinders. However, their mileage and vehicle age were relatively average. On the other hand, the lower-priced clusters generally had lower values for horsepower and engine cylinders and very high mileage. In other words, the higher the horsepower and the number of cylinders, which represent the performance of the vehicle, the higher the price of the vehicle. Also, a negative correlation between mileage and vehicle price is observed. In the cluster with the average vehicle price, the values of horsepower and cylinder were low, but considering that the vehicles were relatively new, it can be observed that the newer the vehicle, the higher the vehicle price. This clustering analysis can provide insights into how different vehicle characteristics affect vehicle prices.</p>
<br/>
<B>Association Rule Mining</B>
<p>Next, an analysis was conducted to identify highly correlated vehicle characteristics in different price ranges using association rule analysis. First, the following features were positively associated with low-priced vehicles: High mileage, FWD, Low Engine Displacement, Low Horsepower, Medium Cylinder, and Short Wheelbase. In other words, cars with high mileage have a relatively low price range, and FWD has a lower price compared to AWD. In addition, Short Wheelbase is a characteristic that represents the size of the vehicle, and smaller vehicles are more likely to be associated with lower prices. It can also be seen that the cylinder attribute of Medium Cylinder is associated with lower prices. In our dataset, a low-cylinder feature is a vehicle with three or fewer cylinders. However, the number is relatively small, so the Medium Cylinder attribute is more prominent in low-priced cars. In other words, the high prevalence of medium cylinders in low-priced vehicles can be interpreted as a result of the small number of low-cylinder vehicles. Next, medium-priced vehicles have characteristics between low-priced and high-priced cars, such as AWD and Medium Cylinder, 2015-2017, Medium Horsepower. It shows that these vehicle characteristics significantly impact the price of the vehicle. Finally, the features opposite to those of lower-priced vehicles are highly correlated for higher-priced cars. The High Cylinder attribute is associated with cars with six or more cylinders, which are relatively high-performance vehicles. In addition, High Torque and Very High Horsepower are also vehicle characteristics that represent high-performance vehicles. As a result of the association rule analysis, the association rules related to these high-performance vehicle characteristics were found in high-priced cars, and it can be interpreted that more of these vehicle characteristics form a high-priced vehicle price. In other words, these association rules can be used to identify factors that affect car prices and help buyers understand which cars with which conditions are likely to have high prices.</p>
<b>Naïve Bayes</b>
<p>Naïve Bayes classification has several advantages for predicting and categorizing vehicle price ranges based on vehicle characteristics. Since the dataset in this project consists of various vehicle characteristics, it is possible to simultaneously consider the impact of multiple vehicle characteristics on vehicle prices, which is a significant advantage of applying Naïve Bayes classification. Furthermore, since Naïve Bayes classification uses a probability-based approach, the impact of vehicle characteristics on vehicle price classification can be calculated probabilistically, which provides a quantifiable understanding of how important each characteristic is to price classification. This is useful when analyzing the relationship between vehicle characteristics and price. Focusing specifically on vehicle characteristics, the analysis results show that vehicles with high-performance engines and power features are valued more highly. The mileage and age of the vehicle also play an essential role in determining the vehicle's price category: the lower the mileage and the newer the vehicle, the higher the price, which may be related to the repair cost. In addition, the vehicle's fuel economy, the fuel tank's size, and the vehicle's size can also affect the price classification of the vehicle. When considering the optimization aspects of the model, it is vital to balance predictive power and model complexity in this analysis. Including more features can provide more information, but it can also lead to poor model performance due to overfitting and poor generalization. In summary, the analysis with Naïve Bayes can confirms a strong correlation between vehicle characteristics and price classification. In particular, significant prediction accuracy can be achieved using only a small number of critical characteristics, suggesting that a vehicle's performance and features can significantly impact its price.</p>
<b>Decision Tree</b>
<p>Decision tree analysis for predicting used car prices helped to effectively identify important attributes and evaluate the model's predictive performance. First, the tree model showed that attributes such as 'torque_lbft', 'year', 'mileage', 'height', 'length', and 'horsepower' significantly impact the price of used cars. In particular, 'horsepower' and 'torque_lbft' appear to have the most significant impact on the model's predictions, while 'width', 'owner_count', 'length', 'mileage', and 'fuel_tank_volume' appear to have a moderate impact. The model classifies vehicles into three price categories: 'Low', 'Moderate', and 'High', and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the model's performance for each price category. Found that the model performed best for the 'Moderate' class, but needed a little more improvement for the 'Low' and 'High' classes. Considering pruning the model to improve its performance, it was found that excessive complexity tuning to improve performance can make the model difficult to interpret, and too much pruning can lead to model underfitting. Finally, various hyperparameter tuning experiments were conducted to see how adjusting the complexity of the model, especially the tuning of minsplit and maxdepth, affects the model's performance. It showed that by setting appropriate parameter values, the model's generalization ability can be improved and overfitting prevented. Through this decision tree analysis, the main characteristics that affect the price of used cars and their influence were understood, which can provide helpful information for consumers and sellers in the used car market when determining prices.</p>
<b>SVMs</b>
<p>An effective classification of vehicle price ranges was achieved using SVM with various kernel functions based on vehicle characteristics. First, vehicle features highly correlated with vehicle price were extracted. To avoid computational inefficiencies and high costs associated with using too many features, SVM was performed based on seven selected vehicle features: 'horsepower', 'torque_lbft', 'width', 'year', 'mileage', 'fuel_tank_volume', and 'highway_fuel_economy'. This resulted in the creation of a model with relatively high classification performance.</p>
<p>One challenge with SVM arises when the number of features exceeds three, making it difficult to visualize decision boundaries. To address this, PCA dimensionality reduction was employed for visualization purposes. While dimensionality reduction may result in some information loss, accuracy had no significant impact. The visualization facilitated a clearer understanding of the decision boundaries for linear or non-linear separation.</p>
<p>In general, the classification of vehicle price points did not exhibit a substantial difference between linear and non-linear separation. However, polynomial and RBF kernels demonstrated more precise boundaries and higher accuracy than linear kernels. This suggests that the various characteristics of a vehicle likely exhibit a non-linear relationship, and polynomial and RBF kernels offer greater flexibility in defining class boundaries compared to linear kernels.</p>
<p>The SVM modeling results provide insights into how specific features contribute to a vehicle's value and allow for the assessment of individual vehicles or models. The model's classification of vehicles offers valuable information on which types of vehicles perform well and the crucial characteristics influencing vehicle prices. Additionally, by classifying vehicles based on data, the model reveals trends or preferences in the market, aiding in understanding vehicle market trends and predicting future demand.</p>
<b>Regression</b>
<p>The multiple linear regression model, considering various features, proves to be a valuable tool for predicting vehicle prices. Given the diverse influences of features such as horsepower, mileage, vehicle age, and size on prices, relying on a single feature often falls short in providing comprehensive explanations. Evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, and R-squared serve as indicators of the model's accuracy and explanatory power, emphasizing low errors and a capability to explain around 65.32% of variability. Particularly, examining the coefficients revealing the impact of each feature on prices sheds light on relationships; for instance, higher horsepower tends to correlate with higher prices, while increased mileage tends to associate with lower prices. This analysis effectively illustrates how the model elucidates the diverse influences of vehicle features on prices, indicating the need for considering additional features for improved predictions in the future.</p>

<p>In conclusion, prospective car buyers are currently facing significant challenges in the used car market due to external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and rising prices, coupled with information asymmetry. The complexity of making purchase decisions based on information underscores the need for reliable insights and comprehensive data.
