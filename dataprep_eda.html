<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<br/>

<p>This project requires a large amount of used vehicle data and state information. For this purpose, we planned to collect data from one of the large online platforms for selling used vehicles, such as Cargurus and Carmax, to obtain vehicle price information as well as various characteristics of used cars. However, most of these platforms do not provide APIs; even if they did, it would require a partnership. For this reason, we decided to collect data through web scraping. In order to collect large amounts of data through web scraping, i.e., scraping a large number of web pages, we continuously make data requests to web servers and collect the data that is responded to. However, for the similar repetitive requests from a given client, the web server detects the bot's activity and blocks the user from accessing it. Eventually, we utilized Selenium to bypass these blocks by performing browser and user interface-like activities on the website, making distinguishing it from a web scraping bot difficult. The code below utilizes Selenium to scrape a webpage.</p>
