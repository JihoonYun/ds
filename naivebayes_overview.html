<b>Naïve Bayes concepts</b>
<p>This step applies a Naïve Bayes classifier to categorize vehicle prices based on vehicle characteristics. A Naïve Bayes classifier is a relatively simple model that trains and predicts quickly. It can efficiently train and predict on rather large datasets, such as the data in this project, and can handle a wide range of categorical and continuous variables. So what is a Naïve Bayes algorithm? As a representative of probability-based machine learning algorithms, the Naïve Bayes algorithm is based on the naïve assumption that each data characteristic is independent of the others and operates based on which label is most probable to classify the data when a new input is received. To approach the Bayesian formula, the conditional probability concept must be understood first. A conditional probability is the probability that something else will happen, given that an event has occurred. The conditional probability is represented by the equation below.</p>
