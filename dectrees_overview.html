<b>What is a Decision Tree?</b>
<p>A decision tree is one of the algorithms in supervised learning in machine learning, and it is an analysis method that plots decision rules in a tree structure. It is a model that analyzes data and predicts outcomes based on a set of questions, as Twenty Questions. Each question classifies data into two or more groups based on specific criteria. This categorization process is represented by a tree structure, with each node representing an answer to a particular question and showing the possible answers. Finally, the leaf nodes represent the outcome. Decision trees are intuitively easy to understand and often used when explanations are needed. The structure of a decision tree can be illustrated as follows.</p>
