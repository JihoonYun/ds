<h2>Clustering Data</h2>
<br/>

<p>To perform clustering based on the vehicle characteristics dataset, there are three main data processing steps: sampling, column extraction, and normalization.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b><I>1. Sampling</I></b></h5>
<p>Performs sampling to make clustering more effective. The total number of rows in the data after data preprocessing is 60,7681. Performing clustering on them will cause problems such as computational complexity, memory usage, and cluster resolution. "Therefore, only 3% of the existing data will be sampled to reduce the data size. After sampling, there will be a total of 18,230 rows. To ensure consistent results across multiple processing runs, an option value of 'random_state' is defined, applied, and then used for the sampling."</p>

<h5><b><I>2. Column Extraction</I></b></h5>
<p>The data to be analyzed in this project contains characteristics of more than 60 cars. Applying clustering to all of this data poses several problems. Such data can increase computational complexity and make it challenging to identify clusters. Processing large amounts of data can reduce the resolution of the clusters and make it difficult to see the fine structure. Given these issues, it is recommended to extract only a few essential columns for analysis before performing clustering. It requires finding columns with unlabeled numeric data types that can be clustered from the preprocessed dataset in the previous step. And then, if vehicle attributes have similar characteristics, such as horsepower or torque, only one representative attribute will be categorized. If all the columns in this dataset were subject to clustering, the dimensionality mentioned above curse would make it difficult to measure the distance between the data. All of the columns below are numeric data types, but the blue columns will only be used for clustering.</p>

<h5><b><I>3. Normalization</I></b></h5>
<p>The dataset used in this project has several characteristics of used cars, and these characteristics may have different scales. Clustering algorithms form clusters based on the distance or similarity between variables, and other scales can distort distance measurements. Therefore, normalizing the data to make each variable have a constant scale is essential in clustering. Every column in the dataset performs a StandardScaler scale to scale the data to a constant range or mean and variance.</p>
