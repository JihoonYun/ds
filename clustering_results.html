<h2>Clustering Results</h2>
<br/>
<p>Based on the data of used vehicles' characteristics, K-means and hierarchical clustering were performed to identify various segments based on vehicle characteristics and the resulting insights. First, the results of K-means clustering are analyzed, which is one of the segmentation clustering techniques. In clustering, k refers to the number of clusters, and this is a significant part of clustering as the clustering results can vary greatly depending on how k is chosen. Since k is a hyperparameter that needs to be determined by the user to select the optimal k, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, which are two techniques measured by different metrics, are first performed. Below is a plot to visualize the results of executing the Elbow Method.</p>
